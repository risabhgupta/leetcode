/**
 * Problem Statement:
 *
 * You are given `n` processes, each represented as a pair `{p, q}` where:
 * - `p` is the time when the process can start execution.
 * - `q` is the time required to complete the process.
 *
 * At any given moment, you can execute up to two processes simultaneously.
 * Your task is to determine the minimum time required to complete all processes.
 *
 * Input:
 * - An integer `n`, the number of processes.
 * - A 2D array `processes` of size `n x 2`, where each row represents a process with:
 *   - `p`: the time at which the process is ready to start.
 *   - `q`: the time required to complete the process.
 *
 * Output:
 * - An integer representing the minimum time required to complete all the processes.
 *
 * Constraints:
 * - 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000
 * - 0 ≤ p, q ≤ 1,000,000
 *
 * Example:
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input:
 * int n = 3;
 * int[][] processes = {{0, 3}, {1, 9}, {2, 6}};
 * Output:
 * 15
 *
 * Explanation:
 * - At time `0`, you can start process `1` (time required = 3).
 * - At time `1`, process `2` is ready. You can start process `2` (time required = 9).
 * - At time `2`, process `3` is ready. Since process `1` is still running, process `3` will
 *   start only when one of the two slots is free.
 * - The processes will complete at the following times:
 *   - Process `1` completes at `3`
 *   - Process `3` completes at `9`
 *   - Process `2` completes at `15`
 * - The total time required is `15`.
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input:
 * int n = 4;
 * int[][] processes = {{0, 3}, {1, 4}, {2, 2}, {3, 5}};
 * Output:
 * 9
 *
 * Explanation:
 * - At time `0`, you can start process `1` (time required = 3).
 * - At time `1`, process `2` is ready. You can start process `2` (time required = 4).
 * - At time `2`, process `3` is ready. Process `3` will start at `3` when process `1` completes.
 * - At time `3`, process `4` is ready. Process `4` will start at `4` when process `2` completes.
 * - The processes will complete at the following times:
 *   - Process `1` completes at `3`
 *   - Process `2` completes at `5`
 *   - Process `3` completes at `5`
 *   - Process `4` completes at `9`
 * - The total time required is `9`.
